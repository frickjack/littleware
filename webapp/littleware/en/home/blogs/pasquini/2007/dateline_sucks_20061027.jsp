        It serves me right for watching Dateline the other night,
     but stalking internet predators is really annoying.

<di:section topic="Dateline">
<p>
One of the gimmicks <em>Dateline</em> 
has pioneered over the last couple
years to improve raitings
is the &quot;snaring the sexual predator&quot; show.
Dateline is a television news magazine on NBC
hosted by Stone Phillips.
Stone begins a typical predator show by introducing
the Internet as a dangerous landscape populated by predators.
There are a ton of horny men online, and the show goes on to
exploit that fact by recruiting a young-looking actress,
and paying her to solicit sex on the Internet while 
masquerading as an underaged teenager.
Inevitably the woman successfully lures various pathetic
men to a house where the Dateline team exposes each
shamed victim on national television, and hands
him over for arrest by a police department cooperating
with the show.
</p>
<p>
This kind of show upsets me for multiple reasons.
<ul>
<li> First, I do not approve of anybody going into a 
      <em> Weight Watchers </em>
    meeting with a tray of brownies, or bringing a
    keg of bear to an <em> A.A. </em> meeting.
    If some sixteen year old girl stupidly advertises
    for sex in various sex and pornography venues
    on the internet, then it is not surprising that
    she hooks several fish.  
    There have been horny bastards since Greek times -
    one step above the dog humping your leg.
    Pornography is a multi-billion dollar world wide industry,
    prostitution is rampant, rape and child molestation are 
    not uncommon.
    We see this again and again from child-molesting priests
    to page-soliciting congressmen to &quot;sex tour&quot;
    vacations to Thailand.
    Dateline does society a disservice when it entices
    otherwise law abiding men into breaking the letter of
    the law by answering an advertisement for free
    sex.
    </li>
<li> Statutory rape and child molestation are serious 
    and common crimes that leave lasting scars on 
    their victims, and are often difficult to prosecute.
    The Dateline crew dilutes the public image of
    these abuses by setting up a ridiculous situation where
    a young but sexually active teenager (not a realistic
    picture of an abuse victim) asks for sex.
   </li>
<li>  Finally, I am annoyed by the false moral indignation that
    the Dateline &quot;reporters&quot; play out.
    There are enough true victims of crime and injustince in America
    and the world withouth manufacturing a story.
    Dateline ought to spend its time and money
    exposing violence in America&apos;s prisons, abuse of women
    in Thailand, prostitution in Vegas, check-cashing stores as
    lone sharks, abuse of illegal aliens by sweatshops in American,
    the U.S. governemnt&apos;s practice of sending prisoners overseas
    to be tortured without due process.
    Inevitably, the Dateline show is sponsored by some
    erectile disfunction drug.
   </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Anyway, I don&apos;t watch this show. I just happened to
catch part of an episode, and I was annoyed by what I saw.
