This package houses some authentication specific classes.

<p>
The SessionUtil, SessionManager, and SessionHelper
are particularly concerned with setting up a JAAS session
for a remote client.
The SessionUtil manages the client configuration to establish
a SessionManager RMI reference by which the client can authenticate
and acquire a SessionHelper reference by which the client
may in turn lookup different littleware services.
</p>
<p>
The ClientLoginModule implements JAAS authentication by
acquiring a SessionManager and authenticating
via SessionManager.login or SessionManager.getSessionHelper.
The SimpleLoginModule is the server-side LoginModule that
manages the SessionManager server&apos;s access to the
littleware password database, but the server may be configured
to authenticate users via other LoginModules via the normal
JAAS policy mechanism.
</p>
<p>
The SubjectInvocationHandler and SessionInvocationHandler
support the construction on the serverside of JAAS aware
dynamic proxies that transparently forward method calls
as PrivilegedActions through Subject.doAs - setting up the
JAAS security context for each client RMI method invocation.
