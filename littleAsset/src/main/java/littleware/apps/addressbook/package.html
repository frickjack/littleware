The littleware.apps.addressbook package defines 
the {@link littleware.apps.addressbook.Address} 
and {@link littleware.apps.addressbook.Contact} asset types
which fascilitate the development of applications
that need to track and group address information.

<p>
A {@link littleware.apps.addressbook.Address} asset is a simple
data bucket indexing different types of addresses
(email, snailmail, phone, ...) associated with
a given location ({@link littleware.apps.addressbook.AddressType}).
A {@link littleware.apps.addressbook.Contact} asset is simply
a colllection of Address interfaces.
</p>

<p>
A client should interact with the classes in this package
via the normal Asset mechanisms.
<ul>
<li> Create a new asset via its AddressAssetType factory: <br />
        Address addr_new = AddressAssetType.ADDRESS.create ();
		</li>
<li> Search for, load, and save an asset via the managers in
       the littleware.asset package. <br />
	   Address addr_load = (Address) m_asset_retriever.getAssetOrNull( uuid_address );
	   </li>
</ul>
</p>
