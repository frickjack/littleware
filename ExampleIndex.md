Index of littleware sample applications.

# Example Applications #

A developer can structure a littleware application in different ways.
The following sample applications illustrate littleware's use in
different kinds of applications (client-server or web based)
and different approaches for mapping application level abstractions
to the littleware node-graph data model.


**[SimpleCL](SimpleCL.md) - a simple command-line client that authenticates against a server, and queries the node graph**

**[LgoCL](LgoCL.md) - a "little go" application that implements the lgo command-interface
> and plugs into the "lgo command" application-launcher framework.**

**[ServerCL](ServerCL.md) - a command line application that launches a littleware server
> which clients may access via RMI**
