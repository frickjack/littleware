Some generic swing and application support widgets.
Try to stick to the MVC pattern.

<p>
We can download some of this crap, and just integrate it.
<ul>
  <li> JWriter - writer to Text widget </li>
  <li> Beanshell integration </li>
  <li> Wizard support </li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Grouping tool idea - just implement as a Wizard
with a very explicity state diagram.  Refer to the
UML documentation.
