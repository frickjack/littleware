 <h3>This is the RMI-tunnel /cgi-bin/ webapp</h3>
 
 <p>
  The default RMI socket factory contains several "fallback"
  mechanisms which enable an RMI client to communicate with a remote
  server.  When an RMI client initiates contact with a remote server,
  it attempts to establish a connection using each of the following
  protocols in turn, until one succeeds:
  <ul>
	  <li>1. Direct TCP connection.</li>
	  <li>2. Direct HTTP connection.</li>
	  <li>3. Proxy connection (SOCKS or HTTP).</li>
	  <li>4. Connection on port 80 over HTTP to a CGI script.</li>
	  <li>5. Proxy HTTP connection to CGI script on port 80.</li>
  </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
  The RMI ServletHandler can be used as replacement for the
  java-rmi.cgi script that comes with the Java Development Kit (and
  is invoked in protocols 4 and 5 above).  The java-rmi.cgi script
  and the ServletHandler both function as proxy applications that
  forward remote calls embedded in HTTP to local RMI servers which
  service these calls.  The RMI ServletHandler enables RMI to tunnel
  remote method calls over HTTP more efficiently than the existing
  java-rmi.cgi script.  The ServletHandler is only loaded once from
  the servlet administration utility.  The script, java-rmi.cgi, is
  executed once every remote call.
  </p>
  <p>
  The ServletHandler class contains methods for executing as a Java
  servlet extension.  Because the RMI protocol only makes use of the
  HTTP post command, the ServletHandler only supports the
  <code>doPost</code> <code>HttpServlet</code> method.  The
  <code>doPost</code> method of this class interprets a servlet
  request's query string as a command of the form
  "<command>=<parameters>".  These commands are represented by the
  abstract interface, <code>RMICommandHandler</code>.  Once the
  <code>doPost</code> method has parsed the requested command, it
  calls the execute method on one of several command handlers in the
  <code>commands</code> array.
  </p>
  <p>
  The command that actually proxies remote calls is the
  <code>ServletForwardCommand</code>.  When the execute method is
  invoked on the ServletForwardCommand, the command will open a
  connection on a local port specified by its <code>param</code>
  parameter and will proceed to write the body of the relevant post
  request into this connection.  It is assumed that an RMI server
  (e.g. SampleRMIServer) is listening on the local port, "param."
  The "forward" command will then read the RMI server's response and
  send this information back to the RMI client as the body of the
  response to the HTTP post method.
  </p>
  <p>
  Because the ServletHandler uses a local socket to proxy remote
  calls, the servlet has the ability to forward remote calls to local
  RMI objects that reside in the ServletVM or outside of it.
