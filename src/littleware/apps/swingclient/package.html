General javax.swing based littleware client components.
Implements MVC pattern.
I do not have much experience with MVC based design,
but here is what we have implemented.

<p>
The MVC pattern 
maps naturally to UI design for applications
with centrally managed data model objects that
need to be viewed and manipulated by different
viewers and controllers.  For example -
a TemparatureTracker model might have many
views and controls observing it.
The AssetModel, JAssetView, JAssetUpdater follow
this kind of pattern.
</p>
<p>
The littleware service managers are database driven,
side effect generating interfaces. 
Most of the littleware.apps.swingclient widgets
focus on providing a UI controls for manipulating
a littleware programming interface rather than 
implementing observers of an in-memory data model.
These control-oriented widgets take the following
approach to MVC - which is kind of weird.
<ul>
<li> Model - the various littleware service interfaces
             define littleware access to the data model.
			</li>
<li> View - each class in littleware.apps.swingclient
		   implementing the LittleTool interface
           defines a swing based views and controls that
		   extend a littleware service manager
		   (SessionManager, SessionHelper, ...)
		   for UI access.
		    </li>
<li> Controller - the LittleTool interface that Views implement provides methods
          by which application controllers may register
		  listeners for handling LittleEvent type events triggered by
		  UI actions against littleware service manager methods.
		  The idea is that a listening controller may update internal state
		  or UI configuration based on the LittleEvent events resulting from
		  littleware API calls that the view/control
		  initialted.
           </li>
</ul>
