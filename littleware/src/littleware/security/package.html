Littleware JAAS implementation and support utilities for
security and authentication.
The littleware.security package maintains the <i>lw_account</li>
security database.  The custom littleware.security.SecurityManager
interface supports implementations of 
javax.security.auth.login and java.security.acl classes
that provide simple identity management, login and authentication,
and access control.

<p>
The identity management classes include simple implementations
of Principal and Group interfaces.
The login support classes include
a LoginModule, LoginContext, and a module callback class.
The access-control-list infrastructure includes
implementations of the Principal, Group, Owner, and Acl
interfaces.
</p>

<p>
The littleware.security data objects (Principal, ACL) are implemented
as specializations and delegations to one or more littleware.asset.Asset
objects.  We're trying to see how far we can go managing our core data
as Asset collections.
</p>  

<h3> Identity Management </h3>

<ul>
<li> SimplePrincipal  - with auto-group creation </li>
<li> SimpleGroup - with Owner concept </li>
</ul>

<h3> Authentication and Login Management </h3>

<h3> Access Control </h3>

<h3> Simple Auditing </h3>

<p>
Implementation of java.util.logging.LogHandler
that logs an audit trail to the lw_audit schema.
</p>

<p>
Some tradeoffs were made in the implementation of the
identity
